OpenWatch for iOS
=================

A next generation [OpenWatch](http://openwatch.net) client for iOS devices.

Downloading the Source
----------------------
When downloading the source make sure to clone the repository with:

    $ git clone git@github.com:OpenWatch/OpenWatch-iOS.git --recursive
 
Or if you didn't use the `--recursive` flag when cloning you can do:

	$ cd /path/to/OpenWatch-iOS
    $ git submodule init
    $ git submodule update
    
This will ensure you have all of the required submodules. 

Running
----------------------

To run the software you'll need to use hardware that supports a camera and hardware accelerated video recording (basically all iOS devices made after the iPhone 3GS). You'll also need an active [iOS developer account](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action), and the most recent version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
